# Swing Strategy Hyperopt Results
**Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Runtime**: 6 minutes 16 seconds  
**Epochs**: 3000  
**Data Period**: July 22, 2025 - August 31, 2025 (40 days)  
**Timeframe**: 5 minutes  
**Loss Function**: CalmarHyperOptLoss  

## ‚ùå NO PROFITABLE PARAMETERS FOUND

The hyperopt could not find any parameter combination that produced profitable results for the Swing strategy during the test period.

## What This Means

### The Swing Strategy Failed Because:
1. **Market Conditions**: The 40-day test period may not have had suitable swing trading opportunities
2. **Strategy Logic**: The swing detection logic may be too restrictive or not well-suited for 5-minute timeframes
3. **Parameter Space**: The parameter ranges defined might not include profitable combinations
4. **Timeframe Mismatch**: Swing trading typically works better on longer timeframes (1h, 4h, daily)

## Original Default Parameters (Not Optimized)
```python
# These are the defaults from the strategy - NOT optimized
buy_params = {
    "buy_momentum_min": 0.02,          # Min momentum threshold
    "buy_price_drop_max": -1.5,        # Max acceptable drop
    "buy_rsi_max": 65,                  # Max RSI
    "buy_rsi_min": 30,                  # Min RSI  
    "buy_swing_lookback": 20,           # Lookback period
    "buy_trend_strength_min": 0.02,    # Min trend strength
    "buy_volatility_max": 0.1,          # Max volatility
    "buy_volume_surge": 1.3,            # Volume surge requirement
}

sell_params = {
    "sell_rsi_high": 80,                # RSI exit threshold
    "sell_take_profit": 0.08,           # Take profit target (8%)
    "sell_trend_reversal": -0.01,       # Trend reversal threshold
    "sell_volume_ratio_low": 0.5,       # Low volume exit
}
```

## Recommendations

### 1. **Don't Use Swing Strategy on 5m Timeframe**
   - Swing trading is designed for longer-term moves
   - Consider using 1h or 4h timeframes instead
   - The noise on 5m makes swing detection unreliable

### 2. **Focus on Working Strategies**
   - **Channel Strategy**: 70.2% win rate, profitable
   - **DCA Strategy**: 68.5% win rate, profitable
   - Allocate more capital to proven strategies

### 3. **If You Want to Fix Swing Strategy**:
   - Test on longer timeframes (1h minimum)
   - Reduce the number of conditions (simplify)
   - Adjust thresholds to be less restrictive
   - Consider market regime filters

### 4. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Convert to a momentum strategy instead of swing
   - Use it only in trending markets
   - Combine with other indicators for confirmation

- **No JSON parameters file** (no good results to save)

## Final Verdict
The Swing strategy in its current form is not suitable for the current market conditions or timeframe. Consider either:
1. Disabling it entirely
2. Redesigning it for longer timeframes
3. Replacing it with a different strategy type

Focus your efforts on the Channel and DCA strategies which both showed positive results during optimization.
