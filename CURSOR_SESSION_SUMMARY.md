# Cursor Session Summary - August 21, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ **Session Objectives**
The user identified critical issues with the crypto trading system:
1. Data fetching issues with Polygon
2. Features (ML and Shadow Testing) built before core trading system was working
3. Runaway data storage on Supabase
4. Need to simplify and stabilize before adding complexity

## âœ… **Major Accomplishments**

### 1. **Data Storage Optimization** 
- **Implemented data retention policy**: 
  - 1-minute data: 30 days
  - 15-minute data: 1 year  
  - 1-hour data: 2 years
  - Daily data: Forever
- **Set up automated cleanup**: Railway cron service running daily at 10 AM UTC
- **Executed initial cleanup**: Removed millions of old records, freed significant space

### 2. **System Simplification**
- **Disabled ML and Shadow Testing**: Created recovery_phase.json config
- **Simplified strategies**: Rule-based with 30% lower thresholds for more signals
  - DCA: -1.0% drop threshold (was -3.5%)
  - Swing: 0.3% breakout (was 2.1%)
  - Channel: 0.35% position (was 0.2%)

### 3. **Hummingbot â†’ Custom Paper Trading Pivot**
- **Attempted Hummingbot integration**: Set up Docker, API, and connectors
- **Hit persistent issues**: Connector not recognized, complex configuration
- **Built custom paper trading engine**: SimplePaperTraderV2 with:
  - Realistic Kraken fees (0.26% taker)
  - Market cap-based slippage (0.08-0.35%)
  - State persistence to JSON files
  - Full position management

### 4. **Enhanced Paper Trading Features** (Today's Session)
- **Adaptive Exit Rules by Market Cap**:
  - Large Cap (BTC/ETH): TP 3-5%, SL 5-7%, Trail 2%
  - Mid Cap: TP 5-10%, SL 7-10%, Trail 3.5%  
  - Small Cap: TP 7-15%, SL 10-12%, Trail 6%
- **Trailing Stops**: Protect profits as price rises
- **Extended Timeout**: 72 hours (3 days) instead of 4 hours
- **Increased Capacity**: 30 positions max (was 10)
- **Faster Data**: 1-minute candles instead of 15-minute
- **Database Persistence**: Saves to paper_trades and paper_performance tables

### 5. **Database Updates**
- **Renamed tables**: hummingbot_trades â†’ paper_trades
- **Added columns**: trading_engine (tracks source), exit_reason
- **Created migrations**: 021 and 022 for schema updates

## ðŸ“‚ **Key Files Created/Modified**

### New Files
- `src/trading/simple_paper_trader_v2.py` - Enhanced paper trading engine
- `scripts/run_paper_trading_v2.py` - Main trading orchestrator  
- `migrations/021_add_trading_engine_column.sql` - DB schema
- `migrations/022_add_exit_reason.sql` - Exit tracking
- `scripts/execute_cleanup_fixed.py` - Data cleanup script
- `scripts/daily_data_cleanup.py` - Railway cron script

### Modified Files
- `src/strategies/manager.py` - ML/Shadow conditional logic
- `src/strategies/simple_rules.py` - Simplified thresholds
- `src/data/hybrid_fetcher.py` - Force use ohlc_data table
- `MASTER_PLAN.md` - Updated with recovery plan and changes

## ðŸš€ **Current System Status**
- **Paper Trading**: Running with enhanced features
- **Data Collection**: Working, using 1-minute candles
- **Strategy Detection**: Simplified rules generating signals
- **Database**: Saving trades (needs exit_reason column added)
- **Railway Services**: 5 services deployed and running
- **Current Positions**: 1 open (GRT), 1 closed (ENJ)

## ðŸ“‹ **Active TODOs**

### âœ… Completed (Aug 21-22)
1. **Add exit_reason column**: âœ… DONE
   - Migration 022_add_exit_reason.sql created and applied
   - Exit reasons now tracked (trailing_stop, take_profit, stop_loss, timeout)

2. **Monitor paper trading performance**: âœ… DONE
   - Created scripts/monitor_paper_trading.py with rich terminal UI
   - Slack notifications implemented for all trades and daily reports
   - System actively monitoring 5 open positions

### Phase 2: Validate Trading System
- Set aggressive test config (lower confidence, smaller positions)
- Monitor and debug trade execution
- Achieve 50+ trades with <5% failure rate

### Phase 3: Reintroduce ML
- Re-enable ML predictions only (not training)
- Validate ML influences trades correctly
- Measure ML impact (target: >5% win rate improvement)

### Phase 4: Add Shadow Testing
- Enable Shadow Testing with 3 variations
- Validate shadow evaluations against real trades

### Other Pending
- Plan architecture for 2nd Polygon websocket connection
- Add backup data source for when Polygon has issues
- Create archive tables for old OHLC data

## ðŸ”§ **Known Issues**
1. **Database**: Missing exit_reason column (SQL provided above)
2. **Warnings**: ShadowLogger.flush() coroutine not awaited (non-critical)
3. **Materialized views**: ohlc_today and ohlc_recent are stale (using ohlc_data)

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Decisions Made**
1. **Prioritize stability over features**: Disabled ML/Shadow Testing
2. **Build custom over complex integration**: Abandoned Hummingbot
3. **Aggressive testing parameters**: Lower thresholds to force signals
4. **Adaptive exits**: Different rules for different market caps
5. **Extended holding periods**: 3 days instead of 4 hours

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**
1. Monitor paper trading performance
2. Wait for 50+ trades to validate system
3. Once stable, gradually reintroduce ML
4. Finally add Shadow Testing for optimization

## ðŸ“Š **Metrics to Track**
- Win rate (target: >50%)
- Number of trades per day
- System stability (uptime)
- Signal generation frequency
- Position diversity across strategies

## ðŸ”— **Important Context**
- Using Polygon.io for data ($49/month, have 2 websockets now)
- Supabase for database (PostgreSQL)
- Railway for deployments and cron jobs
- Slack for notifications
- 90 cryptocurrencies being tracked
- Paper trading with $1000 initial balance

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Reminders**
- System is in recovery/simplification mode
- ML models trained but disabled
- Shadow Testing built but disabled
- Focus is on proving core trading pipeline works
- Once 50+ successful trades, can start adding complexity back

This session successfully pivoted from complex Hummingbot integration to a working custom paper trading system with enhanced features. The system is now running and executing trades with adaptive exit rules based on market cap tiers.
